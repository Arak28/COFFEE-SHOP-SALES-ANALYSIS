# COFFEE-SHOP-SALES-ANALYSIS
## OVERVIEW-
This project presents a complete analysis of data from a coffee shop sales dataset, using MySQL and Power BI. SQL was used to extract and transform key columns. Later, key KPI's such as total sales, order trends, quantity sold, and key trends such as product performance across time, categories, and store locations where analysed. The cleaned and aggregated data was further visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard, enabling detailed insights into business performance.

## OBJECTIVE-
The main objective was to use SQL to genrate queries from the transactional dataset and obtain critical KPIs, including:

1. Total sales, total orders, and quantity sold

2. Month-on-month growth and hourly/daily trends

3. Product-wise and category-wise performance

4. Store location-based comparisons

The output from SQL served as the foundation for developing a Power BI dashboard, offering stakeholders clear insights into the sales behavior, customer preferences and operational trends.
